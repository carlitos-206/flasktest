To whom might grade this, 

I'm not sure if we have to cite open source code that i might have use.
I only used it for CSS background layering. In each CSS doc the I do use
it I decleare by a comment line. There's also some observable customization
that way y'all can see I did not only just dumped code in the 
css file.

In this Doc you will find the url's to the css layers i used.
